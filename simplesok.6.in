.SS Loading external level files
Simple Sokoban can load levels from external *.xsb files. There are two
ways to load such file: either pass it as a parameter on command line,
or drop the file to the Simple Sokoban application window. Note, that
the second method will work only if your windowing system supports it.

Simple Sokoban is also able to load gzipped xsb files.

.SS Command line parameters
Simple Sokoban accepts some command line parameters. If a parameter is
not part of the known list of parameters, then Simple Sokoban assumes it
is the path to a XSB level file.
