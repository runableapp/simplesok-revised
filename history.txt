Simple Sokoban v1.0.7 [18 Sep 2025]:
 - changed the CRC for identifying levels from CRC32 to CRC64. The CRC32
   computation was buggy and led to collisions between solution files so it
   had to be either fixed or replaced. Solution files are now saved with a
   *.sol extension. The previous (buggy) CRC32 method is still performed but
   only as a fallback to import solutions created by pre-1.0.7 versions.
 - support for circular levels (start positions same as end positions)
 - support for solutions with long (>9) RLE sequences (like "10l21ur")
 - level selection screen displays a comment for each level, when available
 - SDL3 compatibility (patch contributed by Patrick Monnerat)

Simple Sokoban v1.0.6 [13 Jan 2024]:
 - new skins by Friedhelm Mehnert (based on G. Wiseman's original work):
   "heavymetal2", "magneto", "marblemagic"
 - added support for uncompressed (*.bmp) skins (thanks to Patrick Monnerat for
   adjusting the autotools setup accordingly)
 - added support for *.png skins
 - removed support for *.bmp.gz skins
 - added support for HUGE skins (larger than 1 MiB)
 - skin format changed: simplesok uses the "common format" skin format now
 - tiles are scaled with a linear filter instead of nearest neigbhor
 - fixed texture bleeding that could occur when zooming in too much
 - obscure --framedelay and --framefreq replaced by --movspeed and --rotspeed
 - animations can be disabled with --movspeed=100 --rotspeed=100
 - animations are automatically disabled on primitive (no-transparency) skins
 - skin is configurable from within an in-game menu
 - much thanks to Friedhelm Mehnert for annoying me with lots of interesting
   complaints and suggestions regarding the processing of skins and textures
